# 289-CPU
 Tiny RISC V CPU based on TinyRV2 as listed here: https://www.csl.cornell.edu/courses/ece4750/handouts/ece4750-tinyrv-isa.txt 
 
 This CPU is designed as a basic non pipelined CPU that can be further expanded on.
 
 Currently the CPU is not in a usable state as the top level control logic still needs to be implemented.
